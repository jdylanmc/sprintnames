# the sprint name generator

I wrote this in a half hour during a retrospective where my team couldn't decide on what our sprint names should be (super heroes, elements, etc).  To modify the list of possible words, just add/remove from words.txt as you see fit.

For development, you'll need to run this in a server.  I prefer using the python simple server:

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```
